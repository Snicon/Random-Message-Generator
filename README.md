# Random-Message-Generator
This project is built as a part of the full-stack career path on Codecademy. As one might be able to see this project is written in pure JavaScript. The random messages are based on programming quotes.

## How to run
``` zsh
node main.js
```

## Is this really it?
Yes, yes it is. I'd probably redirect you to any other project on my github profile. 🤷‍♂️
